**Temperature Conversion**

This is a simple web application that allows users to convert temperatures between Celsius and Fahrenheit. It's a user-friendly tool built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The application provides an intuitive interface for users to enter a temperature value, select the unit (Celsius or Fahrenheit) they want to convert to, and then get the converted result with just a click of a button.

**Features:**

- **Input:** The user can input a temperature value in a text box.
- **Unit Selection:** Users can choose the unit they want to convert to by selecting either Celsius or Fahrenheit using radio buttons.
- **Conversion Logic:** The application provides real-time temperature conversion as the user interacts with the input fields and unit selection.
- **Conversion Formula:** The conversion formula for Celsius to Fahrenheit is `(Celsius * 9/5) + 32`, and for Fahrenheit to Celsius, it is `(Fahrenheit - 32) * 5/9`.
- **Result Display:** The converted temperature is displayed immediately after clicking the "Submit" button.
- **Responsive Design:** The user interface is designed to be responsive and visually appealing on various screen sizes.
